It uses a thin telescope known as laparoscope, which is inserted through small incisions. The laparoscope is connected to a tiny video camera which projects the inside view of patient’s body to a high resolution monitors in the operating room. Small surgical instruments are then passed through one or more additional 3-5mm incisions, through which the surgery is done. These incisions are usually covered with surgical glue and after a few weeks are scarcely visible thus avoiding any follow up visit for suture removal',

                Minimal access Surgery by improving vision and providing magnification up to 20 times makes surgery more precise and accurate with minimal collateral damage. This provides faster recovery and minimal complication after surgery.
                In Minimal access Surgery a small hole is made through the abdominal muscles to permit access to the abdominal cavity by the surgeon. This leads to minimal tissue damage and less pain. In a conventional surgery, all the muscles are cut to gain the access.
                The operative scar in Minimal access Surgery consists of one or more small scars measuring up to 0.5-1.5 cms versus a single large long scar of conventional surgery.`,
