                        Obesity is nowadays a major health hazard so much so
                        that worldwide obesity tripled since 1975. In 2016, more
                        than 1.9 billion adults aged 18 years and older were
                        overweight. Of these over 650 million adults were obese
                        and had obesity related problems. In India the number of
                        obese people has doubled in the last 10 years, according
                        to the National Family Health Survey.

                        With research, we have realized that obesity is
                        difficult to treat and it might require long term
                        changes in lifestyle as well as diet. Several
                        researchers have highlighted that obesity accounts for
                        80-85 per cent of the risk of developing type-2
                        diabetes. The survey highlights that urban population is
                        more prone to obesity as compared to their rural
                        counterparts.

                        Obesity tends to run in families, suggesting there may
                        be a genetic contribution. However, family members also
                        tend to share the same diet and lifestyle habits.
                        Environment also plays a role in obesity. Environmental
                        factors include what and how often a person eats, a{' '}
                        {"person's"} level of activity and behavioral factors.{' '}

                        disastrous results in the younger population thus
                        affecting the newborns of these adults. In 2016, an
                        estimated 41 million children under the age of 5 years
                        were overweight or obese.{' '}

                        The basic cause of obesity and overweight is an energy

                        weight. This weight loss occurs within 9-12 months
                        post-surgery, although some weight regain is normal
