                    The Banded Bypass Surgery is a modification of the RYGB
                    enhancing its restrictive component. The rationale for
                    adding band to a gastric bypass surgery is that the pouch
                    and the stoma sizes are important in the{' '}

                    In the banded GBP (Gastric By-Pass) the pouch and the stoma
                    sizes are calibrated, standardized and reinforced. There is
                    even evidence that the band in the GBP also results in less
                    incidence of – outlet stenosis requiring dilatation, dumping
                    syndrome and reactive hypoglycemia.

                    In the same light it makes a lot of sense to band the
                    sleeve. As Sleeve Gastrectomy is a pure restrictive, one
                    could “prolong” the effect of the restriction by either
                    adding the Fobi’s Ring or MiniMizer Ring or Midcal Ring to
                    it.
