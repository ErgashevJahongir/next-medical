                    The procedure is done laparoscopically and involves
                    implantation of an inflatable gastric band made of silicon
                    to be placed around the upper part of the stomach. This
                    procedure does not involve any cutting or stapling of the
                    stomach.

                    The silicon band is adjustable and the inner diameter can be
                    modified by inflating or deflating it with saline. This band
                    creates a tiny pouch of the stomach which is meant to
                    restrict the amount of food intake. The outlet is also small
                    which ensures an earlier sensation of fullness and satiety
                    with smaller quantities of food, both of these mechanisms
                    result in{' '}

                    . This surgery is considered as the simplest and the least
                    invasive of the bariatric procedures. There is monthly
                    adjustment of the band which is required to achieve best
                    results.
