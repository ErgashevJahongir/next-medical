                    <br />
                    Intra Gastric Balloon procedure is performed with the help
                    of endoscope, a small silicon balloon is placed in upper
                    stomach. It takes 15 – 30 minutes to complete this
                    procedure. It is generally performed under light anaesthesia
                    to make it comfortable. During the procedure the balloon is
                    filled up with 400 – 700ml of coloured fluid.{' '}

                    <strong>Your post procedure recovery:</strong>
                    <br />
                    You may feel full or nauseated for next 2 – 3 days, for this
                    you need to take antacids and anti-emetics. The antacids
                    medication will continue till the balloon is in place. You
                    will start with liquid diet and gradually resume to normal
                    diet in two weeks, your capacity to tolerate most food types
                    will improve day by day, although the portion you will be
                    able to eat in one meal will be considerably reduced. A
                    regular follow up for one year is a must to achieve good
                    weight loss.{' '}

                <Paragraph>
                    <strong>How long is the balloon left in?</strong>
                    <br />
                    Two different systems of intra balloon are used. In one type
                    it is recommended to be removed within 6 months and in the
                    other type the balloon can be kept for as long as one year.
                    The complications may increase or balloon may get deflated
                    beyond the specified time. The balloon may be removed
                    earlier, if you are not feeling good with it.{' '}
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    <strong>What, if the balloon deflates?</strong>
                    <br />
                    The balloon is filled with blue coloured fluid. If the
                    balloon deflates or leaks, it will change the colour of your
                    urine to blue. If you notice this, you must notify the
                    hospital immediately.

                    <strong>How is the balloon removed:</strong>
                    <br />
                    It is removed with endoscopy, under sedation and normally it
                    is a straight forward procedure. The balloon is punctured,
                    deflated, grasped and removed.{' '}

                    <strong>Complications with Intra Gastric Balloon:</strong>
                    <br />
                    In rare instances, it may cause bleeding, perforation,
                    migration leading to obstruction and rarely surgery may be
                    required to deal with these problems. It is essential to
                    continue with healthy eating habits and lifestyle to
                    maintain good weight.
