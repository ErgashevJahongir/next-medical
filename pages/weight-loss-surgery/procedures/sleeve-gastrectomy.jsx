                Historical Background of Sleeve Gastrectomy:
            </ProceduresHeading2>
            <div>
                <Paragraph>
                    It was Doug Hess, in Bowling Green, Ohio, who performed the
                    first open sleeve gastrectomy in March of 1988 as part of
                    what is now known as the duodenal switch procedure. In 1999,
                    the first laparoscopic approach to the duodenal switch was
                    developed on a porcine model by de Csepel, Jossart, and
                    Gagner. Later on due to high complication rate of duodenal
                    switch surgery in very obese individuals, they subsequently
                    developed the technique of staging the intestinal bypass
                    procedure by performing the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy
                    only as an initial stage. It was noted that LSG worked very
                    well as a stand- alone procedure, and majority of these
                    patients did not require the bypass procedure later.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    LSG is technically easier when compared with gastric bypass
                    or biliopancreatic diversion. It is free from serious
                    anatomical intestinal complications in the long run like
                    internal herniation or small bowel obstruction, and the
                    micronutrient deficiencies and malnutrition are less
                    frequent.

                <Paragraph>
                    Laparoscopic/Robotic sleeve gastrectomy which is also known
                    as vertical sleeve gastrectomy is a procedure in which about
                    70 to 80% of the stomach is removed leaving a narrow gastric
                    tube or {'sleeve'} through which food passes. It has now
                    becoming popular at most of the centres as Laparoscopic
                    Sleeve Gastrectomy is technically easier when compared with
                    gastric bypass or biliopancreatic diversion. It is free from
                    serious anatomical intestinal complications in the long run
                    like internal herniation or small bowel obstruction, and the
                    micronutrient deficiencies and malnutrition are less
                    frequent.

                    Patient position remains same as in Roux-en-Y gastric
                    bypass. Number of incisions are 3 to 4.

                    staplers over a special tube called a gastric calibration
                    tube. A leak test may be performed intra operatively to see
                    that the staple line is intact in select group of patients.

                    Mechanism of weight loss after sleeve gastrectomy:
                </ProceduresHeading3>
                <Paragraph>
                    Due to this small stomach tube, the amount of food ingested
                    is restricted and a person can take small amount of food at
                    a time thereby the amount of calories consumed is restricted
                    which results in weight loss.

                    Hormonal changes after Sleeve Gastrectomy:
                </ProceduresHeading3>
                <Paragraph>
                    The removed part of the stomach includes fundus, which is
                    the upper outer part of stomach. It is important as it
                    releases hormone Ghrelin. This hormone is termed as‘hunger
                    hormone’ because it stimulates appetite, increases food
                    intake and promotes fat storage. By removal of fundus, the
                    source of Ghrelin is removed. No intestines are removed or
                    bypassed during Sleeve Gastrectomy so that malabsorption is
                    minimal.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    Having said that, it is not only the restriction that causes
                    the weight loss but many a metabolic changes also occur due
                    to rapid transit of the food in the intestines, releasing
                    intestinal hormones that cause these effect. Thus Sleeve
                    Gastrectomy is no longer considered purely a restrictive
                    surgery but also a metabolic surgery.

                    Weight loss after Sleeve Gastrectomy:
                </ProceduresHeading3>
                <Paragraph>
                    Though, Sleeve Gastrectomy was originally used as a first
                    step procedure for a more definitive gastric bypass in super
                    obese, it is now also used as a single stage procedure with
                    excellent results across the globe. In patients with Reflux
                    Disease and Diabetes the results may be inferior to the
                    Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass but the excess weight loss of both
                    the procedures may be comparable in a select subgroup of
                    patients which is about 80% of the excess weight.

                    It is a simple procedure and the patients may be able to
                    leave the hospital in one day or even the same day in
                    selected cases.
